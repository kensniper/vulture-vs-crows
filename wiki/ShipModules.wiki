= Introduction =

Ships are constructed from modules in a hierarchycal way. The ideea is that every weapon, engine, armor part, generator and other parts on a ship will be a module. If a parent of a module is destroyed so is every child and cannnot be used further. Colosion with particles will be done seperatly for every module of the ship.


= Module Types =

Ill be adding these as I design them:

  # hull
  # engine


== hull ==

A part with no funkcionality other than added protection and space to place other modules on. 


== engine ==

Pushes the ship in one direction. If of center it produces torque to turn the ship. Min 2 engines needed to reach every point in space, at least 3 for normal handling.

= Module Parameters =

== common ==

  # density
    * mass calculated from density and area of the module

== hull ==

no new parameters

== engine ==

  # Thrust _distance `*` mass / time^2_
    * half of screen widht is 1 unit, normal metal density is 1 unit, ship area is about 0.2^2, acceleration should be around 0.1, normal thrust is then about 0.005
